# IceMeme(Ice and MemeHax) Updated!
# By using IceMeme you accept that you wont Sell your exploit in any way

# NOTE: You need to know C++(for the dll/Exploit), C# for external Ui/Gui and how to use Ida(Interactive DisAssembler) for the address and other stuff
# If you only join to ask how to build the dll, how to fix common and simple errors you will be ignored or just called SKID 

**Make sure you are compiling/Building it in Release x86 and not in x64 and/or Debug or you will have errors**
